# Path Not Existent

#### Why This Error Occured

When the `micro` command ran, you passed it a path to a file or directory that does't exist. This is how such a command can look like:

```bash
micro <not-existing-path>
```

#### Possible Ways to Fix It

The only way to fix this is to pass a path to a file or directory that exists and contains a working microservice.
